## 🔧 What this PowerShell Script Fixes

This script doesn't just "open" the game; it actively repairs the following problems:

### 1. Permission & "Access Denied" Errors
* **The Problem:** Windows often blocks the launcher from editing game files.
* **The Fix:** This script uses a built-in "Self-Elevation" technique to gain the necessary permissions to move files and apply patches automatically.

### 2. Missing Files & "Hytale Has Crashed"
* **The Problem:** Antivirus programs often delete files like `Logo@2x.png`, causing a "Critical Error."
* **The Fix:** The script performs an **Integrity Check** and re-downloads only the missing or broken files.

### 3. Connection & "ETIMEDOUT" Issues
* **The Problem:** Downloads fail midway due to server timeouts.
* **The Fix:** Uses a "Resume-Capable" downloader to pick up exactly where it stopped.

### 4. Windows Defender "False Alarms"
* **The Problem:** Antivirus flags the game patcher as a threat.
* **The Fix:** Automatically adds the game folder to the **Windows Defender Exclusion list**.

### 5. "Server Failed to Boot" & Network Issues
* **The Problem:** Blocked network access, corrupted cache, or failed token validation.
* **The Fix:** **Clears UserData**, grants network permissions, and performs a **Windows Time Sync**. It also **updates the JRE files and HytaleServer.jar** to ensure a clean boot.
  
### 6. "Invalid Identity" & Signature Failures
* **The Problem:** `Ed25519 signature verification failed` errors in logs.
* **The Fix:** Detects "kid" mismatches and **re-aligns the authentication system** keys.

### 7. "Play" Button Disabled or Update UI Stuck
* **The Problem:** Launcher gets stuck at 0% or 60%.
* **The Fix:** Bypasses the broken UI and **force-launches Hytale** via PowerShell.
  
### 8. Version Mismatch / "Server is running an older version"
* **The Problem:** Your client version is newer than the server, preventing connection.
* **The Fix:** Performs a **Update server.jar** to align your binaries with the server's requirements.

## ❓ FAQ for Users

**Do I need to delete my old game files before running this?**

No. The script will scan your existing `HytaleF2P` folder and fix whatever is broken.

**Why is the window blue/black text?**

This is the PowerShell interface. It allows the script to perform "Low-Level" repairs that a standard window cannot do.

**How do I know it's finished?**

The script will show a real-time log of what it is fixing. Once it finishes the "Binary Modification," the game will launch automatically.
